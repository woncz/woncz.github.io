# Algorithm

## LeetCode算法题
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49


## Java 程序实现
```
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxArea = 0;
        int i = 0, j = height.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            int area = (j - i) * Math.min(height[i], height[j]);
            if (area > maxArea) maxArea = area;
            if (height[i] < height[j]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```

# Review
[Advice giving: A subtle pathway to power](http://images.transcontinentalmedia.com/LAF/lacom/Advice%20giving_%20A%20subtle%20pathway%20to%20power.pdf)
- the interplay between power and advice giving
- people high on desire for power were more likely to give advice to others
- increased advice giving leads to a boost in power
- this power boost was contingent on the advice being taken
- 找到自己好为人师的原因了
